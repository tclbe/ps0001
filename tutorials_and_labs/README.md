# Tutorial notes

The tutorial notes I have worked on are available freely here.
Each is tagged with a date showing when it was last edited.
Separate code files, consisting of only the code blocks in each set of notes (and nothing more) are also included.
For example, [`1.1-variables_code.py`](./1.1-variables_code.py) is meant as an accompaniment to [`1.1-variables.pdf`](./1.1-variables.pdf).

The files are numbered and ordered according to each week's content, i.e. [`0-installation_and_setup.pdf`](./0-installation_and_setup.pdf) is meant as "week 0" content.
The structure adheres closely to the PS0001 content structure, but spaces out some weeks where the content is overloaded.

Week 2 content is not included, because it is not important for learning Python.

# Tutorial and lab solutions

Some possible solutions for the programming exercises are provided in the subfolders.
The related tutorial questions and lab tasks are not uploaded (yet).
These are correct for AY25/26 Semester 1.

There are many ways to do a single problem, so it is important to understand what you are *supposed to do*, and then *how you can do it* in code.
